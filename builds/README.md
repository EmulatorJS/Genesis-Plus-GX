Here you can find binaries built using latest commited sourcecode, for the following platforms:

* Wii (standalone DOL executable)

* Gamecube (standalone DOL executable)

* Win32 (libretro core DLL)

Notes:

(1) for Gamecube platform, two DOL files are provided:

* genplus_cube.dol is the default DOL version
* genplus_cube_low-mem.dol is an alternate DOL version, with dynamically allocated ROM buffer to reduce DOL memory footprint and fixes issues with loaders using Gamecube Auxiliary RAM (ARAM)

(2) libretro core is meant to be used with Retroarch application and is only provided for testing the core on Win32 platform. It is not representative to official libretro core and is not supported.
